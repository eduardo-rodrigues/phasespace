Installation
============

To install Tensorflow PhaseSpace, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install tfphasespace

This is the preferred method to install Tensorflow PhaseSpace, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _Python installation guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/


For the newest development version (in case you really need it), you can install the version from git with

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/zfit/tfphasespace
